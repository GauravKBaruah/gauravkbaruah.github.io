    Hi! I'm Gaurav Baruah, a DFG Walter-Benjamin Postdoc at Bielefeld University in the Theoretical Biology group. I'm currently working on several research projects, including adaptive species rewiring, eco-evolutionary feedbacks on the resilience of mutualistic networks, bringing collapsed ecological networks back to life, the evolutionary impact of competition on species coexistence, and the evolution of partial migration. All of these are theoretical studies, but I'm using publicly available data from different databases for empirical insights.
