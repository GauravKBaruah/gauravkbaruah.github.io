  <p>
    Hello there! I am Gaurav Baruah, a DFG Walter-Benjamin Postdoc at Bielefeld University in Theoretical Biology group, Faculty of Biology. I currently am working on multiple research projects related to adaptive species rewiring and eco-evolutionary feedbacks on resilience of mutualistic networks, resurrection of collasped ecological networks, evolutionary consequences of competition on species coexistence, and evolution of partial migration. These projects are all theoretical explorations, with empirical data being collected thanks to openly accessible data from various databases.
