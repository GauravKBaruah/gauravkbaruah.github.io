  Social interactions are prevalent in animals, with some individuals participating in more interactions than others. However, the mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity in social interaction frequency and its potential fitness consequences remain poorly characterized. Here, we examine the effects of non-nutritive plant metabolites ("clerodanoids") on social networks and lifespan in the turnip sawfly. ...
