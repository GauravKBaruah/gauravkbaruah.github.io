  Mutualistic ecological networks can suddenly transition to undesirable states, due to small changes in environmental conditions. Recovering from such a collapse can be difficult as reversing the original environmental conditions may be infeasible. Additionally, such networks can also exhibit hysteresis, implying that ecological networks may not recover. Here, using a dynamical eco-evolutionary framework, we try to resurrect mutualistic networks from an undesirable low-functional collapse state to a high-functioning state. ..
