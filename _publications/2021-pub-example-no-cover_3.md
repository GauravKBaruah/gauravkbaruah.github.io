  Loss of resilience in population numbers in response to environmental perturbations may be predicted with statistical metrics called early warning signals (EWS) that are derived from abundance time series. These signals, however, have been shown to have limited success, leading to the development of trait-based EWS that are based on information collected from phenotypic traits such as body size. Experimental work assessing the efficacy of EWS under varying ecological and environmental factors are rare. In addition, disentangling how such warning signals are affected under varying ecological and environmental factors is key to their application in biological conservation. Here, we experimentally test how different rates of environmental forcing (i.e. warming) and varying ecological factors (i.e. habitat quality and phenotypic diversity) affected population stability and predictive power of early warning signals of population collapse. ...
