  Early warning signals (EWS) are phenomenological tools that have been proposed as predictors of the collapse of biological systems. Although a growing body of work has shown the utility of EWS based on either statistics derived from abundance data or shifts in phenotypic traits such as body size, so far this work has largely focused on single species populations...
