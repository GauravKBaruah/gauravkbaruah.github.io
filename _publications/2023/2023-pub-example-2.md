  Gradual changes in the environment could cause dynamical ecological networks to suddenly shift from one state to an alternative state. When this happens ecosystem functions and services provided by ecological networks get disrupted. We, however, know very little about how the topology of such interaction networks can play a role in the transition of ecological networks when spatial interactions come into play. In the event of such unwanted transitions, little is known about how statistical metrics used to inform such impending transitions, measured at the species-level or at the community-level could relate to network architecture and the size of the metacommunity..
