  Predicting population responses to environmental change is an ongoing challenge in ecology. Studies investigating the links between fitness-related phenotypic traits and demography have shown that trait dynamic responses to environmental change can sometimes precede population dynamic responses and thus can be used as an early warning signal. However, it is still unknown under which ecological and evolutionary circumstances shifts in fitness-related traits can precede population responses to environmental perturbation....
