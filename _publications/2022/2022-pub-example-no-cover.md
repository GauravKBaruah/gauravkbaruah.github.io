  lthough the eco-evolutionary effects of individual variation for species coexistence are still widely debated, theoretical evidence appears to support a negative impact on coexistence. Mechanistic models of eco-evolutionary effects of individual variation focus largely on pairwise interactions, while the dynamics of communities where both pairwise and higher-order interactions (HOIs) are pervasive are not known. In addition, most studies have focused on effects of high dimensional HOIs on species coexistence when in reality such HOIs could be highly structured and low-dimensional, as species interactions could primarily be mediated through phenotypic traits. ..
